# tic-tac-toe-challenge

In this project we re-create the tic tac toe game in python giving the user the ability to play against the computer. This is version 1 of the project. The second version will have a much better improved computer AI to give the player a run for there money

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have python version 3.6 or higher installed on your computer

I would also advise if possible you have an IDE from which you could run the file 


### Installing

clone this repo 
open it in your IDE and then proceed to run the file
or for those with no IDE run this command in your terminal `C:\python27\python.exe 'the path to the script'`
This will open up the command line where you will see a board
